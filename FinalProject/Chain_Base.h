 Chain will have the following functions:
 - Chain(istream&, const CardFactory*) is a constructor which accepts an
 istream and reconstructs the chain from file when a game is resumed.
 - Chain<T>& operator+=(Card*) adds a card to the Chain. If the run-time type does not
 match the template type of the chain and exception of type IllegalType needs to be raised.
 - int sell() counts the number cards in the current chain and returns the number coins
 according to the function Card::getCardsPerCoin.
 - and the insertion operator (friend) to print Chain on an std::ostream. The hand should print
 a start column with the full name of the bean, for example with four cards:
 Red R R R R
